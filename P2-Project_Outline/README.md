## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This web app is to help microgreen farmers manage their farms in a more efficient manner by integrating seed inventory, customer orders & planting schedules into one platform. The farmer would be able to plan, track and organize his orders, 
•	Seed inventory: Farmer should be able to check the inventory to see if seeds are in stock to fill an order. Update inventory to reflect seeds used. Supplier information to buy more seeds if needed. Planting information for each type of seed in the inventory – seed density/tray, soaking, watering, days covered and uncovered. 
•	Customer orders: Farmer should be able to manually create a new order & add order information. Once an order is added, calendar should be automatically updated to show planting dates, daily schedule & delivery dates. 
•	Calendar: Farmer should be able to view delivery dates, planting dates & any daily tasks that need to be completed for a particular day by clicking on it.

### Features

•	CRUD Inventory: The farmer can create, read, update and delete the seed inventory database.
•	CRUD Orders: The farmer can create, read, update and delete orders.
•	Auto Update Calendar: When the farmer adds a new order the calendar should auto update to reflect planting schedule & delivery dates for that order.
Other possible features:
•	Search feature: The farmer would be able to search by seed or customer order information.
•	RBA: Farmer login(access to all info), employee login(limited access), customer login(only to order).
•	The farmer would be able to assign orders/tasks to employees.
•	The farmer would be able to mark completed tasks as completed.

### Technologies
Front End (UI): React
Back End (API): Spring, SQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
React is a new tool for most of us on the team & that is something we would have to learn to build our front end UI. We would also have to learn how to link the front end to the back end in order to have a functional web app.
